# Transact Estate Managing Service
The product proposal is to develop an estate manager using Azure IoT. Transact provides clients with a variety of transaction hardware devices to process retail, event, and door access transactions across hundreds of higher education campuses. In University, students use their physical ID cards to access parking lots, library, recereational services, and many more. The current problem is these IoT devices did not have a central system where they could report to. Device failures could not be monitored all the time. Transact did not have visibility to deployed devices to proactively assist clients with current or imminent device failures. Hence, the goal of this product is to solve this problem by developing an estate manager dashboard using Azure IoT services. Currently, Transact and Higher institutions who have authorized access can view their devices, errors, history and location of devices using deployed <a target="_blank" href="https://transact-estate-manager.herokuapp.com/" >website</a>.
